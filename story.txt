There was once a young man named John. He lived on a small farm with his mother. His entire life had been centered around that farm. The animals, the crop, the barn house, that was all that John knew.

The saying often goes, "When the rooster crows" however, for John it was well before. Up before sunrise in bed far into the night. These late nights in this small remote town often experineced odd activity. John kept a log of this activity. One morning he heard a knock on his door. There were four black SUVs blocking his driveway.

Two men were standing at John's door in black suits with about a dozen more people standing back by the SUVs. "What do you farm here Mr. Smith?" one of the men asked. John was suprised, he'd never attracted attention like this before. "Who are you?" John quickly responded in confusion. The same man from before starts to respond, "We're from..." When the other man quickly cut him off by shouting back at John, "WE KNOW IT'S NOT JUST CORN AROUND HERE JOHN!" 

As the men walked around the fields with John in cuffs, they demanded to see more and dissected almost every cob they see. He would grieve over his wasted efforts, if not for that strange feeling that these fields were somehow not his own. John kept walking, faced down, trying to piece everything together when suddenly the shouting went quiet. Only his footsteps remained. He turned to witness nothing but splatters of blood. He realized those "special seeds" at the farmer's market are really something else.
