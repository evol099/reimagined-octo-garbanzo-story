There was once a young man named John. He lived on a small farm with his mother. His entire life had been centered around that farm. The animals, the crop, the barn house, that was all that John knew.

The saying often goes, "When the rooster crows" however, for John it was well before. Up before sunrise in bed far into the night. These late nights in this small remote town often experineced odd activity. John kept a log of this activity. One morning he heard a knock on his door. There were four black SUVs blocking his driveway.

Two men were standing at John's door in black suits with about a dozen more people standing back by the SUVs. "What do you farm here Mr. Smith?" one of the men asked. John was suprised, he'd never attracted attention like this before. "Who are you?" John quickly responded in confusion. The same man from before starts to respond, "We're from..." When the other man quickly cut him off by shouting back at John, "WE KNOW IT'S NOT JUST CORN AROUND HERE JOHN!"

As John was cuffed and demanded to show the way around the farm, he soon realized what they meant. Perhaps they have not realized, but he knew this was not the farm that he had spent his life in. Not anymore. He kept quiet and tried to piece things together, best not to get myself in a worse situation, he thought. He lost his train of thought and looked around. The men were gone. Only splatters of blood and cloth remained. He knew those "special seeds" in the farmer's market really were something quite special.
